# reactDataDoodle_OAuth
When a user logs in to Spotify from [reactDataDoodle](https://reactdatadoodle.netlify.app/) this code serves as the bridge between the Spotify API and the frontend. Big shout-out to mpj and his repo [oauth-bridge-template](https://github.com/mpj/oauth-bridge-template) for serving as a template.
